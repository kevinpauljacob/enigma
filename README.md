Risks of sharing sensitive information like Passwords, Credit Card Information, Private Keys, or other Confidential Data online are increasing daily. 

Enigma is a one-time secret message application that allows users to securely share private information with others. The application is built using React.js and Vite, styled using Tailwind CSS, and utilizes Crypto.js for encryption.

With Enigma, users can create a secret message that can only be accessed once by the intended recipient. The message is encrypted using Crypto.js to ensure that it remains secure until it is opened by the recipient. Once the recipient opens the message, it is immediately deleted from the server, ensuring that the message remains confidential.
